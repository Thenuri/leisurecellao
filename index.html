                        Sri Lanka is a beautiful island in the Indian Ocean.
                        It is located 30 kilometres from the south of India. 
                        Mountains can be found in the south-central region.
                        The rest of the country is mostly low-lying, with flat coastal plains.
                        Many sandy beaches and lagoons could be found throughout the country.
                        Sri Lanka has a 3,000-year known history, with prehistoric human settlements extending back at least 125,000 years.<br><br>
                        It has a rich cultural heritage, with the Pali Canon, Sri Lanka's early Buddhist literature, dating back to the Fourth Buddhist Council in 29 BC.
                        From the old Silk Road to the present Maritime Silk Road, it was strategically important because of its geographic location and deep harbours.
                        Ceylon was the name given to Sri Lanka from the beginning of British colonial control. In the early twentieth century, a nationalist political movement formed in the country in order to gain political independence, which was granted in 1948; the country became a republic in 1972 and took its current name. 
                        The recent history of Sri Lanka
                        Many cultures, languages, and ethnicities can be found on the island. The majority of the population is Sinhalese, however, Tamils have also played a significant role in the island's history. 
                        There are also established groups of Moors, Burghers, and Malays.

                                Characteristics of Sri Lankan arts and crafts are heavily influenced by Buddhist culture. Due to the geographical location of the island, its artistic traditions have influenced Indian form as well. Buddhist religious influence in Sri Lankan art is passed down through generations. Religious ideas are visible in various forms of art, including painting, sculpture, and architecture.
                                <br>
                                <br>
